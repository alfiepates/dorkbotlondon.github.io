With short talks from...

<b>==== Alex Zivanovic ====</b>

"The Senster – an interactive robotic sculpture from 50 years ago"

Alex will talk about the Senster, what it did, how it did it and the lessons
we can learn from it.

He’ll also update us on its recent resurrection to working order.

<b>==== Julie Freeman ====</b>

"ALICE in microbe land or Why we should all be taking the piss to save the planet."

Julie will talk about her latest data art project Active Living Infrastructure:
Controlled Environment (ALICE) which aims to create a live digital interface
between microbes and humans.

Working with Bristol Robotics Lab, and Newcastle University's Experimental
Architecture team, ALICE is concerned with how can we build an interface to
integrate urine consuming electricity producing microbes into our homes. Pee
Power FTW.

<b>==== Air Giants ====</b>

Air Giants are building a new kind of giant soft robot, huge joyful creatures
made of little more than air, light, and fabric. Great big wiggly robots, for
people to interact with, intended for festivals and every kind of creative fun.

They'll talk about what soft robots are, how the team got here, how the robots
work, and what they plan to do with them next.

They're also very interested in finding new collaborations and outlets for the
Giants, so please bring your ideas to the Slack channel.
