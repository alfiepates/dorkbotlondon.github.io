<b>==== Rain Ashford (<a href="https://twitter.com/rainycat">@rainycat</a>) ====</b>
<a href="http://rainycatz.wordpress.com/">rainycatz.wordpress.com</a>

<i>"Designing, coding and building sensor-driven emotive wearables
to amplify physiological data in social situations"</i>
From her AnemoneStarHeart EEG / ECG visualising device to the ThinkerBelle EEG
Amplifying Dress, Rain's doctoral research investigates how wearable technology
could broadcast physiological data from the body to create new forms of
non-verbal communication, and questions the personal, societal and cultural
implications.


<b>==== Bob Sturm (<a href="https://twitter.com/boblsturm">@boblsturm</a>) ====</b>

<i>“Eight short outputs …”</i>
Bob will play a compositional suite generated using a long short-term memory
network with three fully connected hidden layers of 512 units each, trained on
over 23,000 ABC transcriptions of session music (Irish, English, etc.), and
arranged by his own “personal” neural network trained on who knows what for who
knows how long (he can’t remember any of the settings) (2015). And he’ll attempt
to explain a little about them too.


<b>==== Julie Freeman (<a href="https://twitter.com/joz_freeman">@joz_freeman</a>) ====</b>

<i>"Do Naked Mole Rats have data privacy rights?"</i>

research)

<b>==== Plus Special Guest... Di Mainstone! (<a href="http://twitter.com/dimainstone">@dimainstone</a>) ====</b>
<a href="http://dimainstone.com/">dimainstone.com</a>

After speaking at our last event, Di discusses new plans for creating sound and
music from any suitably resonant metal structures...


<b>==== Sputnik Bauble Workshop and "Competition" ====</b>
Hosted by <a href='https://twitter.com/jonty'>@jonty</a> &amp; <a href='https://twitter.com/prehensile'>@prehensile</a>, this essentially involves sticking four bits
of wire to a shiny silver bauble in order to make a 1/10th scale Sputnik-themed
decoration for your festive celebrations. We will be providing baubles, wire
and glue.

Prizes may well be awarded* for the most overengineered bauble. If you feel
inspired to go beyond the baseline Sputnik bauble, you've got a 55mm-diameter
spherical volume to fill with whatever you see fit.

<small>* Prizes may well be more baubles. We've got a lot of baubles.</small>

<b>==== Youtube-powered DORK KARAOKE with <a href='https://twitter.com/fakedavegreen'>@fakedavegreen</a> ====</b>
The evening concludes with (non-compulsory) "Dork Karaoke" of songs we can find
(or ideally download in advance) off of Youtube. Please post your requests via
Twitter or the Facebook event - they don't have to be particularly dorky or
Xmas-y, but ideally they should be short (<4-5min), fairly well-known, and not
highly offensive. Cheers!
